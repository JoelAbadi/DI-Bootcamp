suggestions for improvement:
- In `display_message()`, there's a typo: "funtions" should be "functions".
- In `favorite_book()`, consider using more descriptive variable names (e.g., `book_title` instead of `title`).
- In Exercise 4, the function name `guess_number` is slightly misleading;  a more descriptive name like `compare_numbers` might be better.
- Exercise 7's `get_renaodm_temp()` function has a typo; it should be `get_random_temp()`.
- In Exercise 7, consolidate the `main` function definitions.  There are two separate definitions, which is redundant and confusing.  The code should have only one definition of `main()`.
- In Exercise 7, add more robust input validation to ensure the user enters a valid month (1-12).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code mostly correctly implements the exercises.  Minor typos and a function name issue lower the score slightly.  Exercise 7 is partially incomplete because it has two `main()` functions and does not handle input validation in the month prompt.
- readability: The code is generally well-formatted and easy to understand. Variable and function names are mostly clear, contributing to good readability.
- performance: The code's performance is efficient for the tasks presented. No unnecessary computations are performed.
- security: There are no security concerns in the provided code as it doesn't interact with external systems or handle sensitive data.
