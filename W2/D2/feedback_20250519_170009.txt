suggestions for improvement:
- The docstrings could be improved to be more comprehensive and follow a consistent style.
- Consider adding input validation in `__init__` to ensure `page_size` is a positive integer.
- The `__str__` method could handle empty pages gracefully (e.g., return 'No items on this page' instead of an empty string).
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code accurately implements all the requirements specified in the Chapter Content/Questions.  It correctly handles pagination, navigation methods (including error handling for out-of-range page numbers), and the `__str__` method for displaying items. The test cases all pass, demonstrating complete functionality.
- readability: The code is well-structured and easy to follow.  Variable names are descriptive.  However, adding more comprehensive docstrings would enhance readability further.  The exception handling is clear and concise.
- performance: The algorithm used for pagination and navigation is efficient. The use of list slicing (`items[start:end]`) is optimal for accessing page items. There are no performance bottlenecks in the provided code.
- security: The code includes type checking (`isinstance`) and range validation in `go_to_page` to prevent unexpected errors and improve security by handling invalid inputs.
