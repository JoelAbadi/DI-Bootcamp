suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagrams.py` file is missing, making a complete assessment impossible.  The provided `anagram_checker.py` is a good start but lacks error handling for file I/O and input validation beyond what's in `is_valid_word`.
- The `get_anagrams` method could be optimized for performance. Currently, it iterates through the entire wordlist for each anagram check. A more efficient approach would involve pre-processing the wordlist to group words by their sorted character sets.
- Add more robust input validation in `anagrams.py` to handle edge cases and provide informative error messages to the user.  Specifically, handle cases where the wordlist file is not found or is improperly formatted.

suggestions for improvement:
- The `anagram_checker.py` file is missing, making it impossible to assess the correctness of the AnagramChecker class. The provided code only shows the UI part.
- Error handling could be improved.  Instead of just printing error messages, the program could loop back to the word input prompt.
- The performance could be improved by using more efficient algorithms for anagram detection (e.g., sorting the letters of the word).  The current implementation likely involves many string comparisons.
- Add a more robust way to handle file errors (e.g., file not found).
- Consider adding input validation to ensure the user enters a valid choice (1 or 2) in the menu.
