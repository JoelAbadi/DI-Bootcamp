suggestions for improvement:
- The `build` method is called within `shuffle`.  While functionally correct, it's more efficient to only call `build` once in the constructor.  The `shuffle` method then only needs to shuffle the existing deck. This improves performance as it avoids recreating the entire deck every time the deck is shuffled.
- Add docstrings to methods for better readability and understanding.  Explain what each method does and what it returns.
- Consider adding error handling for invalid suit or value inputs in the `Card` class constructor.
