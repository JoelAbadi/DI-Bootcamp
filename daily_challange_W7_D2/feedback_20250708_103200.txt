suggestions for improvement:
- The code can be improved by adding more comments to explain complex SQL queries.
- Error handling can be enhanced to gracefully handle potential exceptions during database connection or query execution.
- Consider using parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities, although the current example doesn't seem vulnerable because it uses hardcoded values.
- For better performance, especially with larger datasets, explore database optimization techniques such as indexing relevant columns.
