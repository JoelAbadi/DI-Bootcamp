suggestions for improvement:
- The code lacks error handling.  What happens if `hire_date` contains invalid date formats that cannot be parsed by `TO_DATE`?  Add error handling and logging to gracefully manage potential issues during data transformation.
- The outlier detection is arbitrary (salary > 100000).  Consider more robust outlier detection methods, such as using statistical measures (e.g., IQR, standard deviation) to identify values significantly deviating from the norm.
- The code uses `employee_id || employee_name || salary || hire_date || COALESCE(department, '')` to check for duplicates. This is inefficient for large datasets.  Consider using a unique constraint or primary key in the schema if possible for efficient duplicate identification.
- Add comments explaining the purpose of each section of the code, especially for complex queries. While it is possible to infer, clearer commenting would improve readability.
- While the code addresses most points, the normalization of salary is presented as a single query output, not a change to the table.  If normalization is required, update the table to reflect this.  Similarly, the changes to capitalization are also presented as outputs without altering the table itself.  The challenge requires updating the table.
- Consider using transactions to ensure atomicity of operations.  If an error occurs during the update/delete process, roll back the changes to maintain data integrity.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The SQL code addresses most of the data cleaning and transformation tasks outlined in the challenge. It handles missing values, attempts to remove duplicates (though the approach is inefficient), corrects some formatting inconsistencies, updates the `hire_date` data type, identifies potential salary outliers, and demonstrates data standardization. However, it has some flaws in error handling, outlier detection, and the treatment of normalization/standardization as a query instead of a persistent change to the table. The approach to removing duplicates, using `ROW_NUMBER()`, is valid but may be less efficient than using `UNIQUE` constraints at table creation if the database system allows for that.
- readability: The code is mostly readable, with clear SQL statements and some comments. However, additional comments, particularly explaining the logic behind outlier detection and the purpose of various sections, would enhance understanding. The naming of temporary tables could also be more descriptive. 
- performance: The performance can be improved.  The duplicate detection method using string concatenation is not efficient for large datasets.  Also, the outlier detection is based on an arbitrary threshold. More sophisticated techniques would offer better performance and accuracy.  The lack of transaction management may lead to inconsistent data if errors occur during the updates. 
- security: The code does not introduce any apparent security vulnerabilities. It focuses solely on data manipulation within the `employees` table, and there's no interaction with external resources or user inputs that could introduce security risks.
